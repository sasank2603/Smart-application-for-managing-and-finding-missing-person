# AI-Powered Missing Person Tracking System

A comprehensive web application designed to help law enforcement agencies and the public quickly locate missing persons using advanced AI facial recognition technology.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Thousands of people, especially children, go missing every day. Traditional investigative methods, while effective, can be slow and resource-intensive. This project introduces an AI-assisted platform designed to expedite the process of locating missing individuals by:
