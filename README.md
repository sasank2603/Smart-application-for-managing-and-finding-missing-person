A web-based platform designed to help authorities, families, and the public efficiently report, track, and manage missing person cases. The system integrates secure data handling, real-time notifications, and AI-assisted facial recognition to support faster recovery and coordinated response.
Missing person cases often face challenges like delayed reporting, scattered data, and limited communication between authorities and the public.
This project proposes a secure, scalable, and responsive web application that allows users to:

Report missing persons with detailed information and photos

Search and match reports using structured data and AI-assisted modules

Manage and verify cases via admin dashboards

Receive real-time notifications about updates and sightings

The platform aims to strengthen community collaboration and improve recovery time for missing individuals.
